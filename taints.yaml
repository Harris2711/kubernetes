taints are given to  nodes which connects nodes and pods
for example :
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule
i.e
key1=key
value1=value
effect:Noschedule

this taint means that no pods can schedule to this node rather it has a matching toleration

to remove the above taint from node
kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-

to schedule a pod to node which has taint, create a tolertion in pod yaml to get scheduled 
tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "value1"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

  the key, value and effect should be matched according to the node taints
  if there is only a key
  tolerations:
- key: "key1"
  operator: "Exists"
  effect: "NoSchedule"

  for example to attach a toleration to pod
  apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "example-key"
    operator: "Exists"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
