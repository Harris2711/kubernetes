A Pod can have multiple containers running apps within it, but it can also have one or more init containers,
 which are run before the app containers are started.

If a Pod's init container fails, the kubelet repeatedly restarts that init container until it succeeds.
 However, if the Pod has a restartPolicy of Never, and an init container fails during startup of that Pod, 
 Kubernetes treats the overall Pod as failed.
